            <p>
                I have one major goal in my life which I have a feeling won't ever be completed which is fine,
                and it's to become independent from company services as much as possible. Obviously I can't
                completey avoid all the organization...I'm just a regular guy with beginner knowledge and an average
                pay wage. I can only do so much but yet I know I can do a lot to get to my goal. Some examples of things
                I have tried are creating my own VPN, Web server, and AdBlocker.
